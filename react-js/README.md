# Add Usersnap to react app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting up the example

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
The site should be up and running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000)!

## Show me how it's done
The implementation uses `react-helmet`.
Check `App.js` for details. 

Make sure to update global api key and project api key values.
 
If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/usersnap/public/issues).

If you need help on how to use the api, see our [documentation](https://help.usersnap.com/docs/flexible-use-cases-for-global-snippet).
